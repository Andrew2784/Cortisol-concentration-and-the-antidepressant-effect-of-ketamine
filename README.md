# Project Description
This project was performed in Summer 2022 as part of the Office of Student Scholarship, Creative Activities, and Research (OSCAR) Undergraduate Research Scholars Program (URSP) at George Mason University. This project contains a number of files.

The first main document is titled 'OSCAR Proposal.pdf' and it was submitted to the OSCAR committee. As a result of this proposal, I was awarded a $6,000 competitive grant to complete the project. It contains background information about myself and the project so be sure to take a look to learn more.

The next main document is titled 'OSCAR Protocol.pdf' and it contains detailed information about how the project was carried out. This document contains technical information such as statistics and coding. Note: the project protocol lists using Memantine, Lanicemine, and Traxoprodil, which are N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, instead of R-ketamine and S-ketamine, which are also NMDA receptor antagonists, since ketamine is a controlled substance and was unable to be obtained.

The next main document is titled 'OSCAR Schedule.pdf' and it contains day-to-day information on what I accomplished for that day. This was the schedule for the entire summer.

The main code for the model and simulation is located in the 'OSCAR_ModelandSimulation.py' file. It is commented to describe how each class, method, and function works so take a look if you are interested and test it out yourself. The main result was that a higher cortisol concentration led to a longer lasting antidepressant effect which was measured by the number of neuron spikes.

The side code for the model is simulation is located in the 'test.py' file. It contains information that was used to create the main model and simulation. The 'Immunofluorescence Data.xlsx' data is used in this file.
